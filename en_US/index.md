### Our Mission Statement

#### There is an emergency in America - corruption and special interests have a stranglehold on Congress. We are Georgians, from all walks of life, using the power of our Constitution to fix corruption and restore a government of, by and for the people. ![Wolf-PAC GA Logo](https://drive.google.com/uc?export-view&id=1O91SZhV69ySUZerKgeTDvUne-RK5PHe7)

### Who We Are

Wolf-PAC Georgia is a cross-partisan, all-volunteer organization working to achieve meaningful, effective, and durable campaign finance reform by adding a 28th Amendment to the US Constitution through an Article V convention. We believe that whatever your political views may be, we as Georgians have our voices drowned out by well-financed special interests that do not represent our views. The only way to ensure we're represented in Washington is to reform our broken campaign finance system, and we believe that because our state legislators are closer to us, they are best prepared to address this problem.
