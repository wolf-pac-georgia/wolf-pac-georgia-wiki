# What states have already applied for an Article V convention, and on what topic(s)?

The number of existing Article V conventions applications is an area of some dispute, as Congress failed to keep track of convention applications until 2015, when Representative Steve Stivers proposed a change to the House rules. The current 116th Congress has kept this rule in place as Section 103 (b) of the Rules of the House of Representatives.[<sup>1</sup>] While other non-governmental organizations that track Article V convention applications suggest that the number of active applications is higher than the House clerk's count, Congress is the body tasked by Article V with calling a convention, so its count is the most authoritative one.

The House clerk's count of active Article V conventions, along with recissions of previous applications, can be found [here](http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/memorials.aspx). It is important to note that Georgia has called for an Article V convention on two separate topics in recent history, both in 2014: a [convention for a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA)](http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/memorial-pdfs/2014/Memorial-201402-GA.pdf) that would impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, and the [Convention of States convention](http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/memorial-pdfs/2014/Memorial-201401-GA.pdf), which is a multi-topic convention including the BBA, limiting the power of the federal government, and imposing term limits on Congress.

The House clerk's list also demonstrates that proponents of a mandatory general convention, where states Ã§an only call for a convention that is open to any subject, are incorrect, as the House currently counts more than 70 applications from over 38 states, which is far more than the 2/3rds requirement for a convention. If a limited convention were impossible, one clearly would have been called already.
