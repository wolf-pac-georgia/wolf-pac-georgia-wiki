# Article V: What does it say, what does it mean?

### Article V of the U.S. Constitution
###### Ratified June 21, 1788

> "The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate."

### The Two Paths
Article V lays out two different paths Americans can use to amend our Constitution, and they both have three distinct phases: determination of necessity, proposal, and ratification.


#### Path 1: The Congress
Most of us are familiar with the first method laid out in Article V, the one we've used for the 27 amendments added to the Constitution so far. In this method:

1. A member of Congress **determines the necessity** of an amendment and files a resolution so Congress can consider that amendment. 
2. Upon a 2/3rds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Congress as a body **proposes** the amendment in the resolution. 
3. This amendment goes to the states to **ratify**, either through their state legislatures or through amendment conventions; Congress decides which. If 3/4ths of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution.


#### Path 2: The Convention
However, our Founders knew that one day the problem we were trying to fix would /be/ the federal government and Congress, so they devised a way for Americans to amend our Constitution through our state legislatures by convening an Article V Convention. On this path:

1. 2/3rds of the states must **determine that an amendment is necessary** by passing resolutions in their respective legislatures calling for a convention on the topic they wish to address. This topic can be as broad or narrow as the states would like, but 2/3rds of them must agree on the topic.
2. Congress is then required to call a convention composed of delegates from all states to discuss amendments on the topic the states determined required an amendment. This convention then deleiberates and **proposes** an amendment or multiple amendments on that topic to the states.
3. The states then **ratify** those amendments if 3/4ths of them agree to them, just like when Congress proposes amendments.
