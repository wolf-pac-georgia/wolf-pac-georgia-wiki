# How has the Constitution been amended in the past?

While all 27 amendments currently in our Constitution have been proposed using the first path mentioned in Article V, through Congress, many significant amendments have involved movements to use the convention method, which, along with other actions by states and grassroots movements, put pressure on Congress to act.

### 17th Amendment
By far the most prominent amendment influenced by a movement for an Article V convention was the 17th Amendment, which allowed Americans to directly elect our U.S. Senators, instead of having our state legislators select them. Near the turn of the 20th Century, the Senate was commonly reffered to as the "millionaire's club,"[<sup>1</sup>] because powerful political machines often bought off state legislatures and hand picked senators that would serve their interests. The rise of grassroots movements such as the Populist Party, a movement consisting largely of working class farmers, helped to kick of a nationwide push for senators to be held accountable to the people.

The push for an Article V convention to allow the American people to directly elect their senators began in 1893, when Nebraska's state legislature approved an application for a convention. Upwards of 25 out of 45 other states did so over the next two decades, resulting in a total of 75 Article V convention applications on this single subject.[<sup>2</sup>] As Congress saw that the states were rapidly approaching the 2/3rds requirement that would force a convention, they finally took action. In 1912, fearing that a convention would take the entire process out of their control, the Senate approved the amendment that the House had passed every year since 1893, which 3/4ths of the states approved in under eleven months.[<sup>3</sup>] This process has become known as the "prodding effect" for the way the states used the Article V convention to force Congress to take action.[<sup>4</sup>]

It's important to know that even as states were prodding Congress with convention applications, they were also using every other tool they had to support the direct election of senators. 28 states adopted what was known as the "Oregon System" or "Oregon Plan," where the state would hold informal primaries to allow citizens to vote for their senators, and bind state representatives to those votes.[<sup>3</sup>] Even as they pushed for lasting constitutional change, states used their existing options to enhance their democratic processes.

### The Bill of Rights
Although not as prominent as with the 17th Amendment, the Bill of Rights also involved a significant Article V convention immediately after our nation's founding. After the Constitution was proposed and while states were debating its ratification, there were two loose political coalitions that formed in the country: the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. The Federalists supported ratifying the Constitution, while the Anti-Federalists believed it did not protect sufficiently civil liberties, and thus needed a Bill of Rights if the states were to ratify it. The legislatures of Virginia and New York both believe that another convention was the best way to resolve this issue, and passed resolutions calling for a general Article V convention.[<sup>2</sup>] Given that there were only 13 states in the Union at the time, this put significant pressure on Congress to propose the Bill of Rights in 1789, which the states ultimately ratified, to appease the Anti-Federalists and prevent a second convention.

### Other Amendments
While they did not involve the same mass movement as the passage of the 17th Amendment did, the potential for an Article V convention has been a part of other amendments as well. Both the 21st Amendment (the repeal of prohibition) and the 22nd Amendment (presidential term limits) were preceded by states applying for a limited convention on those issues.[<sup>2</sup>]
