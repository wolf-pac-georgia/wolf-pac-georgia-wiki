# How has the Constitution been amended in the past?

While all 27 amendments currently in our Constitution have been proposed using the first path mentioned in Article V, through Congress, many significant amendments have involved movements to use the convention method, which, along with other actions by states and grassroots movements, put pressure on Congress to act.

### 17th Amendment
By far the most prominent amendment influenced by a movement for an Article V convention was the 17th Amendment, which allowed Americans to directly elect our U.S. Senators, instead of having our state legislators select them. Near the turn of the 20th Century, the Senate was commonly reffered to as the "millionaire's club,"[^1] because powerful political machines often bought off state legislatures and hand picked senators that would serve their interests. The rise of grassroots movements such as the Populist Party, a movement consisting largely of working class farmers, helped to kick of a nationwide push for senators to be held accountable to the people.
