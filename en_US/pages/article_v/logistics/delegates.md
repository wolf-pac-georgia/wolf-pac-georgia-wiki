# How would convention delegates be chosen, and how would they be controlled?

__This page is a work in progress. The conflict between current Georgia law and the American Bar Association's interpretation of the "one person, one vote" standard's applicability in light of *Hadley v. Junior College District* will be address ASAP__

### In Georgia
Georgia has a law that determines how the state will select its delegates in the event of an Article V Convention. The Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) ยง28-6-8(b) states that Georgia will appoint seven delegates to the convention: 2 appointed by the Speaker of the House, 2 appointed by the President of the Senate, 2 appointed by the Governor, and 1 chosen by 2/3rds of the previous six delegates.[<sup>1</sup>]

Georgia has also implemented robust enforcement mechanisms to hold delegates accountable to intent of any Article V convention. O.C.G.A ยง28-6-8(c) says that delegates lack the authority to vote for amendments outside of the convention's mandate, and ยง28-6-8(f) requires that delegates swear an oath to that effect. Any delegate who violates that oath would be subject to between 1 and 5 years in prison under O.C.G.A. ยง16-10-1.[<sup>2</sup>]

### Generally
According to the American Bar Association, Supreme Court and appellate court precedents suggest that the "one person, one vote" standard applied to Congressional redistricting in the case /Westbury v. Sanders/ would apply to how delegates are allocated to each state. The ABA suggests that each state should be given as many delegates as they have U.S. Representatives.[<sup>3</sup>]
