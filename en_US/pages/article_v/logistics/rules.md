### How would the convention establish its rules?

The American Bar Association has recommended that Congress pass legislation resolving broad logistical concerns such as the time and place of a convention, how it would be financed, and any other concerns that do not affect the substance of the convention's work, but rather allow it to achieve its purpose.[<sup>1</sup>]

The ABA further suggests that Congress lacks the authority to regulate the internal procedures of a convention, as the debate surrounding Article V at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 suggest that the convention method was meant to be free of Congressional domination.[<sup>1</sup>] A convention would be free to adopt its own rules surrounding its internal procedures. While the convention would have the ability to establish whatever rules it desired, examples of parliamentary procedures commonly used in the United States are *Riddick's Rules of Procedure*, which are based on the rules of the U.S. Senate, *Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure*, which is used by many state legislature, and *Robert's Rules of Order*, which is a more generalized set of parliamentary procedures.
