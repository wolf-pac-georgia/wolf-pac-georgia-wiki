# What are the constitutional checks on an Article V convention?

An Article V convention, just like every other aspect of our government under the Constitution, would be subject to multiple checks and balances. While everyone responsible for implementing these checks would likely do their jobs, the beauty of our system is that even if one set of checks fail, becasue multiple branches of government at the federal and state levels have their own way to check a convention, all of the safeguards are not going to fail at the same time. Checks on an Article V convention could originate from four different places.

## 1. The states
The most powerful check on an Article V convention is the extremely high ratification requirement set forth in the Constitution. Article V requires that 3/4ths – currently 38 – of the states vote to ratify any proposed amendment to the Constitution, regardless of whether Congress or a convention proposes it. If the states feel a convention exceeded its authority, all they have to do is vote down – or simply refuse to vote on – any amendments the convention proposes.

Additionally, the states can control the way their individual delegates vote throughout the duration of the convention. Some states such as Georgia have passes laws specifically detailing the discretion, or lack thereof, that their delegates have, and make it a criminal penalty for their delegates to violate those limitations.

## 2. The Congress
Although the convention method does not allow Congress to interfere with the substance of a lawful convention, Congress does have a role to play in ensuring a convention stays on topic. Most legal analyses have concluded that Congress has the authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution to pass legislation governing the procedure of convening a convention. One proposed bill, S. 1272 in the 93rd session of Congress in 1973, proposed a mechanism whereby if a convention called under Article V proposed amendments outside the scope of the mandate it was covened under, Congress could vote not to forward the proposed amendments to the states for ratification. __The American Bar Association has endorsed such a "same-subject" test as within Congress's constitutional authority.__
