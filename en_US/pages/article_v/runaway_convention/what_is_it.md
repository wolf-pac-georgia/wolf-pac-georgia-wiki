# The "Runaway Convention": Myth vs. Fact

According to the Congressional Research Service, "the 'runaway convention' has been generally defined as an Article V Convention summoned to consider a particular issue or issues (e.g., a balanced federal budget requirement) that ventures beyond its original mandate to consider policy questions and potential amendments contemplated neither in relevant applications by the state legislatures nor in its congressional summons."[<sup>1</sup>] Some proponents of this theory go further to suggest that once called, there are no constitutional checks and balances available for the federal or state governments to a convention, with others even wildly suggesting that a convention could set a new standard for ratification. __This theory and its derivatives, though widespread, do not have the support of available evidence.__ The relevant arguments, and the appropriate rebuttals to them, can roughly be broken down into three categories.

## 1. "A Second Philadelphia"

#### Myth: The Philadelphia Convention threw out the Articles of Confederation, so an Article V Convention would throw out the Constitution
This is by far the most common argument against an Article V convention, but also one of the most erroneous. Proponents of the "Second Philadelphia" argument mistakenly liken a convention called under Article V of the constitution to the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. The Philadelphia Convention was called by Congress to suggest amendments within the confines of the Articles of Confederation, which required that any amendments to the Articles be proposed by Congress and *unanimously* approved by the States.[<sup>2</sup>] Instead, the Philadelphia Convention proposed an entirely new constitution and a new mode of ratification – 3/4ths of the states instead of unanimous consent – and thus "ran away" from their original mandate. Those who believe in this myth incorrectly fear that an Article V convention would propose amendments outside of its limited mandate.

#### Fact: The Philadelphia Convention is an entirely different type of convention than an Article V convention
As the Department of Justice concluded in its examination of the Second Philadelphia argument, __"the 'second Philadelphia' argument is an interesting theory, but no evidence can be marshalled to show that it has anything to do with an Article V convention."__[<sup>3</sup>] This is because the Philadelphia Convention was not a mechanism within the Article of Confederation, so it was not bound by that document's rules. __In contrast, because an Article V convention would be within the framework of the US Constitution, it is subject to all of the checks and balances that come with it.__ The Philadelphia Convention was a massive gamble to save our young union, and as a result, "our existing constitution is the product of a revolution, bloodless though it was."[<sup>4</sup>] The Framers knew that this process was not a healthy way to amend our Constitution, and wrote Article V, including the convention method, in direct contrast to it. In *The Federalist Papers No. 85*, Alexander Hamilton wrote that __"there can ... be no comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete Constitution."__[<sup>5</sup>]

## 2. The Supra-Constitutional Convention

#### Myth: An Article V convention would be an assembly of the people that exists above and outside of the Constition, and would have virtually limitless power
This argument is the most extreme variant Wolf-PAC has come across. It argues that there are no checks on what a convention, once convene, can do, including changing the threshold for ratification of proposed amendments. Proponents suggest, as Senator Weldon Heydon (R-ID) stated in 1911 when arguing against state convention calls for what eventually became the 17th Amendment, "when the people of the United States meet in a constitutional convention there is no power to limit their action. They are greater than the Constitution, and they can repeal the provision that limits the right of amendment. They can repeal every section of it, because they are the peers of the people who made it."[<sup>6</sup>] This is the idea of so-called "conventional sovereignty," where a conveniton would have the voice and power of the American people, and thus be superior to all branches of government and to the Constitution. 

#### Fact: An Article V convention exists inside the carefully crafted framework of the Constitution, and would be limited by the document it was created by
The problem with this argument is that it gets too caught up in the *idea* of a national convention and . As noted in a report to the House Judiciary Commmittee in 1957, "A constitutional convention appointed under law and the Constitution, which presumes to overpass the limits impossed upon it by its creators, and seeks to do acts requiring the exercise of revolutionary powers, ceases to be a constitutional convention and becomes in the eye of the law an extralegal or revolutionary convention."[<sup>7</sup>] In other words, __a convention that attempted to subvert the procedures of Article V and rest of the Constitutional is illegal and unconstitutional.__

## 3. Amendent(s)

#### Myth: Article V says that Congress "shall call a convention for proposing amendments," so a convention would be empowered to propose whatever amendments it saw necessary, and could not be limited
This line of argument suggests that because Article V referes to "amendments" in the plural, there can be no limits place by the states or by Congress on a convention's ability to consider multiple amendments, regardless of their subject.[<sup>8</sup>] There is not substantially more to the argument than this. This is not to dismiss the argument out of hand, but to note that its proponents rely on gramatical syntax as oppossed to legislative history and context.

#### Fact: The Framers clearly envision that a convention could be called for a specific, limited purpose
As the American Bar Association points out, "the origins and history of Article V indicate that both general and limited conventions were within the contemplation of the Framers."[<sup>9</sup>] The easiest way to understand why this must be true is to reason through it. If the Framers intended only for the states to be able to call a general convention, they would be asking the states to submit applications to Congress essentailly saying, "we want to change the constitution, and the way it is changed does not much matter to us." Furthermore, the Framers explicitly contemplated that Article V would be used to address individual issues with the Constitution as they came up. In *The Federalist No. 85*, Alexander Hamilton wrote that "every amendment to the Constitution, if once established, would be a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. There would then be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to any other point no giving nor taking."[<sup>5</sup>] In fact, as this quote demonstrates, the Framers specifically worried about a general convention creating the type of bargaining that was present at the Philadelphia Convention, thus the creation of the procedures in Article V to prevent the necessity of that happening again.

## 4. "How do we know?"

#### Myth: There are too many uncertainties surrounding an Article V convention and whether it can be limited, so it is to dangerous to call one
This final argument can best be summarized as "don't poke the bear." It is legimiate to say that there are unknowns related to an Article V convention, as there has never been one before. Critics of a convention often cite Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe[<sup>10</sup>] or the late Supereme Court Justice Antonin Scalia[<sup>11</sup>] as proponents of this argument, although they do so out of context.

#### Fact: We know we can limit an Article V convention to the topic it is called on, and much of the opposition on this point is either fearmongering or taken out of context
The argument of avoiding an Article V convention because it has never been done before is often, though not always, an attempt to take good-faith questions academics and legal experts have about how an Article V convention would proceed and turn them into fear-mongering to say we should never have a convention if any of these questions are unresolved. To address Professor Tribe's and Justice Scalia's comments specifically:
  
* Professor Tribe's words at a 2011 conference on the idea of an Article V convention speak for themselves: "I would also object very much to someone who said that because I don’t know the answers to all the questions about an Article V Convention I would oppose ever having one. And that’s why I made very clear that I don’t take that view."[<sup>12</sup>] He further suggests in the same talk that he could potentially see the need for a limited convention on an issue that is structurally difficult for Congress to address, specifically name-checking campaign finance reform.
* Justice Scalia was strongly supportive of an Article V convention early in his career, as is demonstrated by his remarks at an American Enterprise Institute forum on the topic where he said that "the Congress is simply unwilling to give attention to many issues which it knows the people are concerned with, which issues involve restrictions upon the federal government's own power. I think the founders foresaw that, and they provided this method in order to enable a convention to remedy that."[<sup>13</sup>] Scalia supported a convention to balance the federal budget, but clarified that he "[did not] much care what it is used for the first time, but using it once will exert an enormous influence on both the Congress and the Supreme Court. It will establish the parameters of what can be done and how, and after that the Congress and the Court will behave much better."
