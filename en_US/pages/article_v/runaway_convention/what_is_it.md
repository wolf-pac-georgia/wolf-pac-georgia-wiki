# The "Runaway Convention": Myth vs. Fact

According to the Congressional Research Service, "the 'runaway convention' has been generally defined as an Article V Convention summoned to consider a particular issue or issues (e.g., a balanced federal budget requirement) that ventures beyond its original mandate to consider policy questions and potential amendments contemplated neither in relevant applications by the state legislatures nor in its congressional summons."[<sup>1</sup>] Some proponents of this theory go further to suggest that once called, there are no constitutional checks and balances available for the federal or state governments to a convention. __This theory and its derivatives, though widespread, do not have the support of available evidence.__ The relevant arguments, and the appropriate rebuttals to them, can roughly be broken down into four categories.

## 1. "A Second Philadelphia"

#### Myth:
Proponents of the "Second Philadelphia" argument mistakenly liken a convention called under Article V of the constitution to the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. The Philadelphia Convention was called by Congress to suggest amendments within the confines of the Articles of Confederation, which required that any amendments to the Articles be proposed by Congress and *unanimously* approved by the States.[<sup>2</sup>] Instead, the Philadelphia Convention proposed an entirely new constitution and a new mode of ratification – 3/4ths of the states instead of unanimous consent – and thus "ran away" from their original mandate. Those who believe in this myth incorrectly fear that an Article V convention would propose amendments outside of its limited mandate.

#### Fact:
As the Department of Justice concluded in its examination of the Second Philadelphia argument, __"the 'second Philadelphia' argument is an interesting theory, but no evidence can be marshalled to show that it has anything to do with an Article V convention."__[<sup>3</sup>] This is because the Philadelphia Convention was not a mechanism within the Article of Confederation, so it was not bound by that document's rules. __In contrast, because an Article V convention would be within the framework of the US Constitution, it is subject to all of the checks and balances that come with it.__ The Philadelphia Convention was a massive gamble to save our young union, and as a result, "our existing constitution is the product of a revolution, bloodless though it was."[<sup>4</sup>] Our Founder knew that this process was not a healthy way to amend our Constitution, and wrote Article V, including the convention method, in direct contrast to it. In *The Federalist Papers No. 85*, Alexander Hamilton wrote that __"there can ... be no comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete Constitution."__[<sup>5</sup>]

## 2. The Extra-Constitutional Convention

#### Myth:


#### Fact:

## 3. Amendent(s)

### Myth:

### Fact:

## 4. "How do we know?"
"Could anyone really believe, for example, that a court would feel bound to treat the equal rights amendment (ERA) as part of the Constitution if Congress determined that the thirty-five states that had ratified the amendment as of July 1, 1982, constituted the "three fourths" of fifty required by article V?"[<sup>6</sup>]

While the arguments above are the most common runaway convention fears we've heard, you might occaisionally hear some other variant. As we hear them, we'll attempt to add our rebuttals to them in this space.

## 5. The Mandatory General Convention
