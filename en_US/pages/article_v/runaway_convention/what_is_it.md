# What is a "runaway convention," and why is it not a real thing?

According to the Congressional Research Service, "the 'runaway convention' has been generally defined as an Article V Convention summoned to consider a particular issue or issues (e.g., a balanced federal budget requirement) that ventures beyond its original mandate to consider policy questions and potential amendments contemplated neither in relevant applications by the state legislatures nor in its congressional summons."[<sup>1</sup>] Proponents of this theory suggest that once called, there are no constitutional checks and balances available for the federal or state governments to a convention. Suporting evidence for the theory of a runaway convention can generally be broken down into roughly four arguments:

#### 1. The "Second Philadelphia" Argument
Proponents of the "Second Philadelphia" argument mistakenly liken a convention called under Article V of the Constitution to the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. The Philadelphia Convention was called by the Founders outside of the Articles of Confederation (the governing document of the United States after the Revolutionary War and before the adoption of the Constitution), which required that any amendments to the Articles be proposed by Congress and *__unanimously__* approved by the States.[<sup>2</sup>] Instead, the Philadelphia Convention proposed an entirely new constitution, which was clearly outside their authority, and thus "our existing constitution is the product of a revolution, bloodless though it was," and __not the product of any procedure that resembles and Article V Convention__.[<sup>3</sup>] In short, as the Department of Justice concluded in its examination of the Second Philadelphia argument, "the 'second Philadelphia' argument is an interesting theory, but no evidence can be marshalled to show that it has anything to do with an Article V convention."[<sup>4</sup>]

#### 2. The Extra-Constitutional Argument

#### 3. The Plural Amendments Argument

#### 4. The Uncertainty Argument
"Could anyone really believe, for example, that a court would feel bound to treat the equal rights amendment (ERA) as part of the Constitution if Congress determined that the thirty-five states that had ratified the amendment as of July 1, 1982, constituted the "three fourths" of fifty required by article V?"[<sup>5</sup>]

----
While there may be other ways to phrase arguments in support of the possibility of a runaway convention, all good-faith arguments essentially boil down to these three arguments.
