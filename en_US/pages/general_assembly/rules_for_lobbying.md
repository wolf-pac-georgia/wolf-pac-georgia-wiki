# Things to be aware of when lobbying

### Capitol and Coverdell Legislative Office Buidling (CLOB) security regulations and tips
* __All adults must show a photo ID.__ Please bring this with you!
* Everyone must go through airport-style security (walk through a metal detector and place carried items in an x-ray machine)
* You will likely cross back and forth between these buildings frequently, so have your ID handy and try to limit the items you bring to essentials
* __No weapons__, including pocket knives

### Decorum and best practices

* Please avoid wearing any non-Wolf-PAC political clothing. We encourage diverse political views in our members, but we ask that when you represent Wolf-PAC to our state legislators that you stick to the issue of campaign finance reform
* Pictures are allowed throughout the Capitol, with the exception of the House and Senate Galleries when the General Assembly is in session
* Posters and signs are allowed, but must have dimensions of 22-by-28 in. or less according to the Georgia Building Authority's regulations
